It's required for the Game Jam I joined but my game doesn't require codes, it's a drag and drop type of game engine called Clickteam Fusion 2.5.
1/2 - MESSAGE TO GAME OFF 2021 HOST: Good day. I really don't use github, the engine I use is Clickteam Fusion 2.5 which doesn't use heavy scripting or coding. It's drag and drop.
2/2 - I hope this is enough. I attached the MFA files of the game which are the files you need to work on the game with Clickteam Fusion 2.5.
